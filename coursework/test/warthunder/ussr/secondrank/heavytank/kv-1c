The KV-1S is a rank II Soviet heavy tank with a battle rating of 4.0 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.57 "Battle March". A lightened KV-1 made to improve its manoeuvrability, the KV-1S has less overall armour than the original design but keeps its same lethality with improved speed.

Compared to the KV-1 L-11, side and rear armour are decreased to 60 mm, lightening the vehicle and increasing its speed to maximum 43 kph. A new turret was installed, presenting a smaller profile, thicker armour, and better angling all around. The armament is also changed to the ZIS-5, the equivalent of its successor and the T-34's F-34 guns.
