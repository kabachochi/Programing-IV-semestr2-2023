The SU-122 is a rank II Soviet tank destroyer with a battle rating of 2.3 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41. This vehicle was created on T-34 chassis and carries a fearsome 122 mm M-30 howitzer.

The main feature of this SPG is a powerful gun, but you have to make a good use of the first shot. It also has a very strong frontal armour which will deflect most kinetic shells at its BR.

It is very hard for it to hit targets from over 500 m in Realistic and Simulator battles, so its users often resort to rushing an enemy tank and shooting it at point-blank range, but this only works if there are no other enemy tanks because with an untrained crew it can take anywhere from 20 to 33 seconds before the SU-122 has reloaded.
