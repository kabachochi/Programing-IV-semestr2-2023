The Begleitpanzer 57 is a rank VI German light tank with a battle rating of 9.7 (AB) and 9.3 (RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.73 "Vive la France".

At first glance, the Begleitpanzer 57 may be confused for a SPAA due to the light armoured chassis and the rapid-firing 57 mm autocannon. On the turret is also a TOW launcher with SACLOS guidance, meaning it will automatically align itself with where the crosshair is pointing.

As it shares the same chassis, the Begleitpanzer 57's construction is similar to that of the Marder A1-, with light armour all around and sides that heavy machine guns can penetrate. The main cannon's exterior mounting also means it can be disabled by machine guns and shrapnel.

As a light tank, the Begleitpanzer 57 carries great firepower and high mobility. The 57 mm autocannon has a penetration power close to that of the ZSU-57-2's, but the addition of a TOW launcher system makes this vehicle able to engage heavier targets.
